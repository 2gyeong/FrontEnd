        This holiday
        You'll be far away
        And I'll be all alone
        So please remember
        This December
        To fully charge your phone
        And
        Text me Merry Christmas
        Let me know you care
        Just a word or two
        Of text from you
        Will remind me you're still there
        You don't have to add much to it
        One smiley face will do
        Baby text me Merry Christmas
        'Cause I'm missing kissing you
     </div>
    <div class = "div3"> <img src="../img/img-04/pic2.jpg"> </div>
    <div class = "div4">         
        Text me Merry Christmas
        Make my holiday complete
        Though you're far from me
        Say you'll B-R-B
        That's a text I'll never delete
        Choose just the right emoji
        One that makes me L-O-L
        And if you text me something naughty I promise I won't tell
        
        I don't care if you spell things right
        I just want to hear from you tonight
        Stroke those keys with your delicate touch
        And type those little words that mean so much!</div>
