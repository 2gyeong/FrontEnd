        Santa, tell me if you're really there? Don't make me fall in love again
        If he won't be here next year. Santa, tell me if he really cares
        'Cause I can't give it all away
        If he won't be here next year

        Feeling Christmas all around
        And I'm trying to play it cool
        But it's hard to focus when I see him walkin' 'cross the room
        "Let it Snow" is blasting out
        But I won't get in the mood
        I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know
        It's true love that he thinks of
        So next Christmas
        I'm not all alone, boy

        Santa, tell me if you're really there
        Don't make me fall in love again
        If he won't be here next year
